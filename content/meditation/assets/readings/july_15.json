{"month":"july","date":"15","entry":{"Morning":{"verses":[{"passage":"The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.","reference":{"book":"Leviticus","chapter":"6","verse":"13"}}],"reading":["Keep the altar of <i>private prayer</i> burning. This is the very life of all piety. The sanctuary and family altars borrow their fires here, therefore let this burn well. Secret devotion is the very essence, evidence, and barometer, of vital and experimental religion.","Burn here the fat of your sacrifices. Let your closet seasons be, if possible, regular, frequent, and undisturbed. Effectual prayer availeth much. Have you nothing to pray for? Let us suggest the Church, the ministry, your own soul, your children, your relations, your neighbours, your country, and the cause of God and truth throughout the world. Let us examine ourselves on this important matter. Do we engage with lukewarmness in private devotion? Is the fire of devotion burning dimly in our hearts? Do the chariot wheels drag heavily? If so, let us be alarmed at this sign of decay. Let us go with weeping, and ask for the Spirit of grace and of supplications. Let us set apart special seasons for extraordinary prayer. For if this fire should be smothered beneath the ashes of a worldly conformity, it will dim the fire on the family altar, and lessen our influence both in the Church and in the world.","The text will also apply to <i>the altar of the heart</i>. This is a golden altar indeed. God loves to see the hearts of his people glowing towards himself. Let us give to God our hearts, all blazing with love, and seek his grace, that the fire may never be quenched; for it will not burn if the Lord does not keep it burning. Many foes will attempt to extinguish it; but if the unseen hand behind the wall pour thereon the sacred oil, it will blaze higher and higher. Let us use texts of Scripture as fuel for our heart’s fire, they are live coals; let us attend sermons, but above all, let us be much alone with Jesus."]},"Evening":{"verses":[{"passage":"He appeared first to Mary Magdalene.","reference":{"book":"Mark","chapter":"16","verse":"9"}}],"reading":["Jesus “appeared first to Mary Magdalene,” probably not only on account of her great love and persevering seeking, but because, as the context intimates,<i>she had been a special </i><i>trophy of Christ’s delivering power</i>. Learn from this, that the greatness of our sin before conversion should not make us imagine that we may not be specially favoured with the very highest grade of fellowship. She was one who had left all to become <i>a constant attendant on the Saviour</i>. He was her first, her chief object. Many who were on Christ’s side did not take up Christ’s cross; <i>she</i> did. <i>She spent her substance </i><i>in relieving his wants</i>. If we would see much of Christ, let us <i>serve</i> him. Tell me who they are that sit oftenest under the banner of his love, and drink deepest draughts from the cup of communion, and I am sure they will be those who give most, who serve best, and who abide closest to the bleeding heart of their dear Lord. But notice <i>how</i> Christ revealed himself to this sorrowing one—by a <i>word</i>, “Mary.” It needed but one word <i>in his voice</i>, and at once she knew him, and <i>her heart </i><i>owned allegiance by another word</i>, her heart was too full to say more. That one word would naturally be the most fitting for the occasion. It implies obedience. She said, “<i>Master</i>.” There is no state of mind in which this confession of allegiance will be too cold. No, when your spirit glows most with the heavenly fire, then you will say, “I am thy servant, thou hast loosed my bonds.” If you can say, “Master,” if you feel that his will is your will, then you stand in a happy, holy place. He must have said, “Mary,” or else you could not have said, “Rabboni.” See, then, from all this, how Christ honours those who honour him, how love draws our Beloved, how it needs but one word of his to turn our weeping to rejoicing, how his presence makes the heart’s sunshine."]}}}
