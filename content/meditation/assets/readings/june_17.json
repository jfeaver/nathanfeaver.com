{"month":"june","date":"17","entry":{"Morning":{"verses":[{"passage":"Help, Lord.","reference":{"book":"Psalm","chapter":"12","verse":"1"}}],"reading":["<i>The prayer itself is remarkable</i>, for it is <i>short</i>, but <i>seasonable, sententious</i>, and <i>suggestive</i>. David mourned the fewness of faithful men, and therefore lifted up his heart in supplication—when the creature failed, he flew to the Creator. He evidently felt his own weakness, or he would not have cried for help; but at the same time he intended honestly to exert himself for the cause of truth, for the word “help” is inapplicable where we ourselves do nothing. There is much of <i>directness, clearness of perception</i>, and <i>distinctness of </i><i>utterance</i> in this petition of two words; much more, indeed, than in the long rambling outpourings of certain professors. The Psalmist runs straight-forward to his God, with a well-considered prayer; he knows what he is seeking, and where to seek it. Lord, teach us to pray in the same blessed manner.","<i>The occasions for the use of this prayer are frequent</i>. In providential afflictions how suitable it is for tried believers who find all helpers failing them. Students, in <i>doctrinal </i><i>difficulties</i>, may often obtain aid by lifting up this cry of “Help, Lord,” to the Holy Spirit, the great Teacher. Spiritual warriors in <i>inward conflicts</i> may send to the throne for reinforcements, and this will be a model for their request. Workers in <i>heavenly labour</i> may thus obtain grace in time of need. Seeking sinners, in <i>doubts and alarms</i>, may offer up the same weighty supplication; in fact, in all these cases, times, and places, this will serve the turn of needy souls. “Help, Lord,” will suit us living and dying, suffering or labouring, rejoicing or sorrowing. In him our help is found, let us not be slack to cry to him.","<i>The answer to the prayer is certain</i>, if it be sincerely offered through Jesus. The Lord’s character assures us that he will not leave his people; his relationship as Father and Husband guarantee us his aid; his gift of Jesus is a pledge of every good thing; and his sure promise stands, “Fear not, <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\" id=\"d0617am-p5.1\">I will help thee</span>.”"]},"Evening":{"verses":[{"passage":"Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it.","reference":{"book":"Numbers","chapter":"21","verse":"17"}}],"reading":["Famous was the well of Beer in the wilderness, because it was <i>the subject of a promise</i>: “That is the well whereof the Lord spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.” The people needed water, and it was promised by their gracious God. We need fresh supplies of heavenly grace, and in the covenant the Lord has pledged himself to give all we require. The well next became <i>the cause of a song</i>. Before the water gushed forth, cheerful faith prompted the people to sing; and as they saw the crystal fount bubbling up, the music grew yet more joyous. In like manner, we who believe the promise of God should rejoice in the prospect of divine revivals in our souls, and as we experience them our holy joy should overflow. Are we thirsting? Let us not murmur, but sing. Spiritual thirst is bitter to bear, but we need not bear it—the promise indicates a well; let us be of good heart, and look for it. Moreover, the well was <i>the centre of prayer</i>. “Spring up, O well.” What God has engaged to give, we must enquire after, or we manifest that we have neither desire nor faith. This evening let us ask that the Scripture we have read, and our devotional exercises, may not be an empty formality, but a channel of grace to our souls. O that God the Holy Spirit would work in us with all his mighty power, filling us with all the fulness of God. Lastly, the well was <i>the object of effort</i>. “The nobles of the people digged it with their staves.” The Lord would have us active in obtaining grace. Our staves are ill adapted for digging in the sand, but we must use them to the utmost of our ability. Prayer must not be neglected; the assembling of ourselves together must not be forsaken; ordinances must not be slighted. The Lord will give us his peace most plenteously, but not in a way of idleness. Let us, then, bestir ourselves to seek him in whom are all our fresh springs."]}}}
