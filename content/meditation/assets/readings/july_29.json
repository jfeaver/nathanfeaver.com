{"month":"july","date":"29","entry":{"Morning":{"verses":[{"passage":"Nevertheless I am continually with thee.","reference":{"book":"Psalm","chapter":"73","verse":"23"}}],"reading":["“<i>Nevertheless</i>,”—As if, notwithstanding all the foolishness and ignorance which David had just been confessing to God, not one atom the less was it true and certain that David was saved and accepted, and that the blessing of being constantly in God’s presence was undoubtedly his. Fully conscious of his own lost estate, and of the deceitfulness and vileness of his nature, yet, by a glorious outburst of faith, he sings “nevertheless I am continually with thee.” Believer, you are forced to enter into Asaph’s confession and acknowledgment, endeavour in like spirit to say “nevertheless, since I belong to Christ I am continually with God!” By this is meant continually upon his <i>mind</i>, he is always thinking of me for my good. Continually before his <i>eye</i>;—the eye of the Lord never sleepeth, but is perpetually watching over my welfare. Continually in his <i>hand</i>, so that none shall be able to pluck me thence. Continually on his <i>heart</i>, worn there as a memorial, even as the high priest bore the names of the twelve tribes upon his heart forever. Thou always thinkest of me, O God. The bowels of thy love continually yearn towards me. Thou art always making providence work for my good. Thou hast set me as a signet upon thine arm; thy love is strong as death, many waters cannot quench it; neither can the floods drown it. Surprising grace! Thou seest me in Christ, and though in myself abhorred, thou beholdest me as wearing Christ’s garments, and washed in his blood, and thus I stand accepted in thy presence. I am thus continually in thy favour—“continually with thee.” Here is comfort for the tried and afflicted soul; vexed with the tempest within—look at the calm without. “<i>Nevertheless</i>”—O say it in thy heart, and take the peace it gives. “Nevertheless I am continually with thee.”"]},"Evening":{"verses":[{"passage":"All that the Father giveth me shall come to me.","reference":{"book":"John","chapter":"6","verse":"37"}}],"reading":["This declaration involves <i>the doctrine of election</i>: there are some whom the Father gave to Christ. It involves <i>the </i><i>doctrine of effectual calling</i>: these who are given must and shall come; however stoutly they may set themselves against it, yet they shall be brought out of darkness into God’s marvellous light. It teaches us <i>the indispensable necessity of faith</i>; for even those who are given to Christ are not saved except they come to Jesus. Even <i>they</i> must come, for there is no other way to heaven but by the door, Christ Jesus. All that the Father gives to our Redeemer <i>must come to him</i>, therefore none can come to heaven except they come to Christ.","Oh! the power and majesty which rest in the words “<i>shall </i><i>come</i>.” He does not say they have power to come, nor they may come if they will, but they “<i>shall come</i>.” The Lord Jesus doth by his messengers, his word, and his Spirit, sweetly and graciously compel men to come in that they may eat of his marriage supper; and this he does, not by any violation of the free agency of man, but by the power of his grace. I may exercise power over another man’s will, and yet that other man’s will may be perfectly free, because the constraint is exercised in a manner accordant with the laws of the human mind. Jehovah Jesus knows how, by irresistible arguments addressed to the understanding, by mighty reasons appealing to the affections, and by the mysterious influence of his Holy Spirit operating upon all the powers and passions of the soul, so to subdue the whole man, that whereas he was once rebellious, he yields cheerfully to his government, subdued by sovereign love. But how shall those be known whom God hath chosen? By this result: that they do willingly and joyfully accept Christ, and come to him with simple and unfeigned faith, resting upon him as all their salvation and all their desire. Reader, have you thus come to Jesus?"]}}}
