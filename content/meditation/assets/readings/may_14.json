{"month":"may","date":"14","entry":{"Morning":{"verses":[{"passage":"Joint heirs with Christ.","reference":{"book":"Romans","chapter":"8","verse":"17"}}],"reading":["The boundless realms of his Father’s universe are Christ’s by prescriptive right. As “heir of all things,” he is the sole proprietor of the vast creation of God, and he has admitted us to claim the whole as ours, by virtue of that deed of joint-heirship which the Lord hath ratified with his chosen people. The golden streets of paradise, the pearly gates, the river of life, the transcendent bliss, and the unutterable glory, are, by our blessed Lord, made over to us for our everlasting possession. All that he has he shares with his people. The crown royal he has placed upon the head of his Church, appointing her a kingdom, and calling her sons a royal priesthood, a generation of priests and kings. He uncrowned himself that we might have a coronation of glory; he would not sit upon his own throne until he had procured a place upon it for all who overcome by his blood. Crown the head and the whole body shares the honour. Behold here the reward of every Christian conqueror! Christ’s throne, crown, sceptre, palace, treasure, robes, heritage, are yours. Far superior to the jealousy, selfishness, and greed, which admit of no participation of their advantages, Christ deems his happiness completed by his people sharing it. “The glory which thou gavest me have I given them.” “These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.” The smiles of his Father are all the sweeter to him, because his people share them. The honours of his kingdom are more pleasing, because his people appear with him in glory. More valuable to him are his conquests, since they have taught his people to overcome. He delights in his throne, because on it there is a place for them. He rejoices in his royal robes, since over them his skirts are spread. He delights the more in his joy, because he calls them to enter into it."]},"Evening":{"verses":[{"passage":"He shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom.","reference":{"book":"Isaiah","chapter":"40","verse":"11"}}],"reading":["Who is he of whom such gracious words are spoken? He is <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\" id=\"d0514pm-p3.1\">the Good Shepherd</span>. <i>Why</i> doth he carry the lambs in his bosom? Because <i>He hath a tender heart, and any weakness at once melts his </i><i>heart</i>. The sighs, the ignorance, the feebleness of the little ones of his flock draw forth his compassion. <i>It is his </i><i>office</i>, as a faithful High Priest, to consider the weak. Besides, <i>he purchased them with blood, they are his </i><i>property</i>: he must and will care for <i>that</i> which cost him so dear. Then he is <i>responsible for each lamb</i>, bound by covenant engagements not to lose one. Moreover, <i>they are all a </i><i>part of his glory and reward</i>.","But how may we understand the expression, “He will <i>carry</i> them”? Sometimes he carries them by <i>not permitting them to </i><i>endure much trial</i>. Providence deals tenderly with them. Often they are “carried” by being filled with <i>an unusual </i><i>degree of love</i>, so that they bear up and stand fast. Though their knowledge may not be deep, they have great sweetness in what they do know. Frequently he “carries” them by giving them <i>a very simple faith</i>, which takes the promise just as it stands, and believingly runs with every trouble straight to Jesus. The simplicity of their faith gives them an unusual degree of confidence, which carries them above the world.","“He carries the lambs <i>in his bosom</i>.” Here is <i>boundless </i><i>affection</i>. Would he put them in his bosom if he did not love them much? Here is <i>tender nearness</i>: so near are they, that they could not possibly be nearer. Here is <i>hallowed </i><i>familiarity</i>: there are precious love-passages between Christ and his weak ones. Here is <i>perfect safety</i>: in his bosom who can hurt them? They must hurt the Shepherd first. Here is <i>perfect rest and sweetest comfort</i>. Surely we are not sufficiently sensible of the infinite tenderness of Jesus!"]}}}
