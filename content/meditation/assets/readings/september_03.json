{"month":"september","date":"03","entry":{"Morning":{"verses":[{"passage":"Thou whom my soul loveth.","reference":{"book":"Song of Solomon","chapter":"1","verse":"7"}}],"reading":["It is well to be able, without any “if” or “but,” to say of the Lord Jesus—“<i>Thou whom my soul loveth</i>.” Many can only say of Jesus that they <i>hope</i> they love him; they <i>trust</i> they love him; but only a poor and shallow experience will be content to stay here. No one ought to give any rest to his spirit till he feels quite sure about a matter of such vital importance. We ought not to be satisfied with a superficial <i>hope</i> that Jesus loves us, and with a bare trust that we love him. The old saints did not generally speak with “buts,” and “ifs,” and “hopes,” and “trusts,” but they spoke positively and plainly. “I know whom I have believed,” saith Paul. “I know that my Redeemer liveth,” saith Job. Get positive knowledge of your love of Jesus, and be not satisfied till you can speak of your interest in him as a reality, which you have made sure by having received the witness of the Holy Spirit, and his seal upon your soul by faith.","True love to Christ is in every case the Holy Spirit’s work, and must be wrought in the heart by him. He is the <i>efficient </i><i>cause</i> of it; but the logical reason why we love Jesus lies in <i>himself. Why</i> do we love Jesus? <i>Because he first loved </i><i>us. Why</i> do we love Jesus? Because he “<i>gave himself for </i><i>us</i>.” We have life through his death; we have peace through his blood. Though he was rich, yet <i>for our sakes</i> he became poor. Why do we love Jesus? Because of the <i>excellency of his </i><i>person</i>. We are filled with a sense of his beauty! an admiration of his charms! a consciousness of his infinite perfection! His greatness, goodness, and loveliness, in one resplendent ray, combine to enchant the soul till it is so ravished that it exclaims, “Yea, he is altogether lovely.” Blessed love this—a love which binds the heart with chains more soft than silk, and yet more firm than adamant!"]},"Evening":{"verses":[{"passage":"The Lord trieth the righteous.","reference":{"book":"Psalm","chapter":"11","verse":"5"}}],"reading":["All events are under the control of Providence; consequently all the trials of our outward life are traceable at once to the great First Cause. Out of the golden gate of God’s ordinance the armies of trial march forth in array, clad in their iron armour, and armed with weapons of war. All providences are doors to trial. Even our mercies, like roses, have their thorns. Men may be drowned in seas of prosperity as well as in rivers of affliction. Our mountains are not too high, and our valleys are not too low for temptations: trials lurk on all roads. Everywhere, above and beneath, we are beset and surrounded with dangers. Yet no shower falls unpermitted from the threatening cloud; every drop has its order ere it hastens to the earth. The trials which come from God are sent to prove and strengthen our graces, and so at once to illustrate the power of divine grace, to test the genuineness of our virtues, and to add to their energy. Our Lord in his infinite wisdom and superabundant love, sets so high a value upon his people’s faith that he will not screen them from those trials by which faith is strengthened. You would never have possessed the precious faith which now supports you if the trial of your faith had not been like unto fire. You are a tree that never would have rooted so well if the wind had not rocked you to and fro, and made you take firm hold upon the precious truths of the covenant grace. Worldly ease is a great foe to faith; it loosens the joints of holy valour, and snaps the sinews of sacred courage. The balloon never rises until the cords are cut; affliction doth this sharp service for believing souls. While the wheat sleeps comfortably in the husk it is useless to man, it must be threshed out of its resting place before its value can be known. Thus it is well that Jehovah trieth the righteous, for it causeth them to grow rich towards God."]}}}
