{"month":"january","date":"30","entry":{"Morning":{"verses":[{"passage":"When thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, then thou shalt bestir thyself.","reference":{"book":"2 Samuel","chapter":"5","verse":"24"}}],"reading":["The members of Christ’s Church should be very prayerful, always seeking the unction of the Holy One to rest upon their hearts, that the kingdom of Christ may come, and that his “will be done on earth, even as it is in heaven;” but there are times when God seems especially to favour Zion, such seasons ought to be to them like “the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees.” We ought then to be doubly prayerful, doubly earnest, wrestling more at the throne than we have been wont to do. Action should then be prompt and vigorous. The tide is flowing—now let us pull manfully for the shore. O for Pentecostal outpourings and Pentecostal labours. Christian, in yourself there are times “when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees.” You have a peculiar power in prayer; the Spirit of God gives you joy and gladness; the Scripture is open to you; the promises are applied; you walk in the light of God’s countenance; you have peculiar freedom and liberty in devotion, and more closeness of communion with Christ than was your wont. Now, at such joyous periods when you hear the “sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees,” is the time to bestir yourself; now is the time to get rid of any evil habit, while God the Spirit helpeth your infirmities. Spread your sail; but remember what you sometimes sing—","Only be sure you have the sail up. Do not miss the gale for want of preparation for it. Seek help of God, that you may be more earnest in duty when made more strong in faith; that you may be more constant in prayer when you have more liberty at the throne; that you may be more holy in your conversation whilst you live more closely with Christ.","“I can only spread the sail;","Thou! Thou! must breathe the auspicious gale.”"]},"Evening":{"verses":[{"passage":"In whom also we have obtained an inheritance.","reference":{"book":"Ephesians","chapter":"1","verse":"11"}}],"reading":["When Jesus gave himself for us, he gave us all the rights and privileges which went with himself; so that now, although as eternal God, he has essential rights to which no creature may venture to pretend, yet as Jesus, the Mediator, the federal head of the covenant of grace, he has no heritage apart from us. All the glorious consequences of his obedience unto death are the joint riches of all who are in him, and on whose behalf he accomplished the divine will. See, he enters into glory, but not for himself alone, for it is written, “Whither the Forerunner is <i>for us</i> entered.” <a class=\"scripRef\" id=\"d0130pm-p3.1\" href=\"/ccel/bible/asv.Heb.6.html#Heb.6.20\" onclick=\"return goBible('nt','Heb','6','20','6','20');\" onmouseover=\"popupVerse(this, 'Heb 6:20 - 6:20')\" onmouseout=\"leaveVerse()\" name=\"_Heb_6_20_0_0\">Heb. 6:20</a>. Does he stand in the presence of God?—“He appears in the presence of God <i>for us</i>.” <a class=\"scripRef\" id=\"d0130pm-p3.2\" href=\"/ccel/bible/asv.Heb.9.html#Heb.9.24\" onclick=\"return goBible('nt','Heb','9','24','9','24');\" onmouseover=\"popupVerse(this, 'Heb 9:24 - 9:24')\" onmouseout=\"leaveVerse()\" name=\"_Heb_9_24_0_0\">Heb. 9:24</a>. Consider this, believer. You have no right to heaven in yourself: your right lies in Christ. If you are pardoned, it is through <i>his</i> blood; if you are justified, it is through <i>his</i> righteousness; if you are sanctified, it is because <i>he</i> is made of God unto you sanctification; if you shall be kept from falling, it will be because you are preserved in Christ Jesus; and if you are perfected at the last, it will be because you are complete in <i>him</i>. Thus Jesus is magnified—for all is in him and by him; thus the inheritance is made certain to us—for it is obtained in him; thus each blessing is the sweeter, and even heaven itself the brighter, because it is Jesus our Beloved “in whom” we have obtained all. Where is the man who shall estimate our divine portion? Weigh the riches of Christ in scales, and his treasure in balances, and then think to count the treasures which belong to the saints. Reach the bottom of Christ’s sea of joy, and then hope to understand the bliss which God hath prepared for them that love him. Overleap the boundaries of Christ’s possessions, and then dream of a limit to the fair inheritance of the elect. “All things are yours, for ye are Christ’s and Christ is God's.”"]}}}
