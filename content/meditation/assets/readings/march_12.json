{"month":"march","date":"12","entry":{"Morning":{"verses":[{"passage":"Thou shalt love thy neighbour.","reference":{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"5","verse":"43"}}],"reading":["“Love thy neighbour.” Perhaps he rolls in riches, and thou art poor, and living in thy little cot side-by-side with his lordly mansion; thou seest every day his estates, his fine linen, and his sumptuous banquets; God has given him these gifts, covet not his wealth, and think no hard thoughts concerning him. Be content with thine own lot, if thou canst not better it, but do not look upon thy neighbour, and wish that he were as thyself. Love him, and then thou wilt not envy him.","Perhaps, on the other hand, thou art rich, and near thee reside the poor. Do not scorn to call them neighbour. Own that thou art bound to love them. The world calls them thy inferiors. In what are they inferior? They are far more thine equals than thine inferiors, for “God hath made of one blood all people that dwell upon the face of the earth.” It is thy coat which is better than theirs, but thou art by no means better than they. They are men, and what art thou more than that? Take heed that thou love thy neighbour even though he be in rags, or sunken in the depths of poverty.","But, perhaps, you say, “I cannot love my neighbours, because for all I do they return ingratitude and contempt.” So much the more room for the heroism of love. Wouldst thou be a feather-bed warrior, instead of bearing the rough fight of love? He who dares the most, shall win the most; and if rough be thy path of love, tread it boldly, still loving thy neighbours through thick and thin. Heap coals of fire on their heads, and if they be hard to please, seek not to please <i>them</i>, but to please <i>thy </i><i>Master</i>; and remember if <i>they</i> spurn thy love, thy Master hath not spurned it, and thy deed is as acceptable to him as if it had been acceptable to them. Love thy neighbour, for in so doing thou art following the footsteps of Christ."]},"Evening":{"verses":[{"passage":"To whom belongest thou?","reference":{"book":"1 Samuel","chapter":"30","verse":"13"}}],"reading":["No neutralities can exist in religion. We are either ranked under the banner of Prince Immanuel, to serve and fight his battles, or we are vassals of the black prince, Satan. “To whom belongest thou?”","Reader, let me assist you in your response. <i>Have you been </i><i>“born again”</i>? If you have, you belong to Christ, but without the new birth you cannot be his. <i>In whom do you trust</i>? For those who believe in Jesus are the sons of God. <i>Whose work are </i><i>you doing</i>? You are sure to serve your master, for he whom you serve is thereby owned to be your lord. <i>What company do </i><i>you keep</i>? If you belong to Jesus, you will fraternize with those who wear the livery of the cross. “Birds of a feather flock together.” <i>What is your conversation</i>? Is it heavenly or is it earthly? <i>What have you learned of your Master</i>?—for servants learn much from their masters to whom they are apprenticed. If you have served your time with Jesus, it will be said of you, as it was of Peter and John, “They took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.”","We press the question, “To whom belongest thou?” Answer honestly before you give sleep to your eyes. If you are not Christ’s you are in a hard service—<i>Run away from your cruel </i><i>master</i>! Enter into the service of the Lord of Love, and you shall enjoy a life of blessedness. If you <i>are</i> Christ’s let me advise you to do four things. You belong to Jesus—<i>obey </i><i>him</i>; let his word be your law; let his wish be your will. You belong to the Beloved, then <i>love him</i>; let your heart embrace him; let your whole soul be filled with him. You belong to the Son of God, then <i>trust him</i>; rest nowhere but on him. You belong to the King of kings, then <i>be decided for him</i>. Thus, without your being branded upon the brow, all will know to whom you belong."]}}}
