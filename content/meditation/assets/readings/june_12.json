{"month":"june","date":"12","entry":{"Morning":{"verses":[{"passage":"Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting.","reference":{"book":"Daniel","chapter":"5","verse":"27"}}],"reading":["It is well frequently to weigh ourselves in the scale of God’s Word. You will find it a holy exercise to read some psalm of David, and, as you meditate upon each verse, to ask yourself, “Can I say this? Have I felt as David felt? Has my heart ever been broken on account of sin, as his was when he penned his penitential psalms? Has my soul been full of true confidence in the hour of difficulty as his was when he sang of God’s mercies in the cave of Adullam, or in the holds of Engedi? Do I take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord?” Then turn to the life of Christ, and as you read, ask yourselves how far you are conformed to his likeness. Endeavour to discover whether you have the meekness, the humility, the lovely spirit which he constantly inculcated and displayed. Take, then, the epistles, and see whether you can go with the apostle in what he said of his experience. Have you ever cried out as he did—“O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” Have you ever felt his self-abasement? Have you seemed to yourself the chief of sinners, and less than the least of all saints? Have you known anything of his devotion? Could you join with him and say, “For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain”? If we thus read God’s Word as a test of our spiritual condition, we shall have good reason to stop many a time and say, “Lord, I feel I have never yet been here, O bring me here! give me true penitence, such as this I read of. Give me real faith; give me warmer zeal; inflame me with more fervent love; grant me the grace of meekness; make me more like Jesus. Let me no longer be ‘found wanting,’ when weighed in the balances of the sanctuary, lest I be found wanting in the scales of judgment.” “Judge yourselves that ye be not judged.”"]},"Evening":{"verses":[{"passage":"Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling.","reference":{"book":"2 Timothy","chapter":"1","verse":"9"}}],"reading":["The apostle uses the perfect tense and says, “Who <i>hath</i> saved us.” Believers in Christ Jesus <i>are</i> saved. They are not looked upon as persons who are in a hopeful state, and may ultimately be saved, but they <i>are</i> already saved. Salvation is not a blessing to be enjoyed upon the dying bed, and to be sung of in a future state above, but a matter to be obtained, received, promised, and enjoyed now. The Christian is perfectly saved <i>in God’s purpose</i>; God has ordained him unto salvation, and that purpose is complete. He is saved also as to the <i>price </i><i>which has been paid for him</i>: “It is finished” was the cry of the Saviour ere he died. The believer is also perfectly saved <i>in his covenant head</i>, for as he fell in Adam, so he lives in Christ. This complete salvation is accompanied by <i>a holy </i><i>calling</i>. Those whom the Saviour saved upon the cross are in due time effectually called by the power of God the Holy Spirit unto holiness: they leave their sins; they endeavour to be like Christ; they choose holiness, not out of any compulsion, but from the stress of a new nature, which leads them to rejoice in holiness just as naturally as aforetime they delighted in sin. God neither chose them nor called them because they were holy, but he called them that they might be holy, and holiness is the beauty produced by his workmanship in them. The excellencies which we see in a believer are as much the work of God as the atonement itself. Thus is brought out very sweetly the fulness of the grace of God. Salvation must be of grace, because the Lord is the author of it: and what motive but grace could move him to save the guilty? Salvation must be of grace, because the Lord works in such a manner that our righteousness is forever excluded. Such is the believer’s privilege—<i>a present </i><i>salvation</i>; such is the evidence that he is called to it—<i>a </i><i>holy life</i>."]}}}
