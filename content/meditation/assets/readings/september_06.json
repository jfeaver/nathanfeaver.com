{"month":"september","date":"06","entry":{"Morning":{"verses":[{"passage":"In the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.","reference":{"book":"Philippians","chapter":"2","verse":"15"}}],"reading":["We use lights to <i>make manifest</i>. A Christian man should so shine in his life, that a person could not live with him a week without knowing the gospel. His conversation should be such that all who are about him should clearly perceive whose he is, and whom he serves; and should see the image of Jesus reflected in his daily actions. Lights are intended for <i>guidance</i>. We are to help those around us who are in the dark. We are to hold forth to them the Word of life. We are to point sinners to the Saviour, and the weary to a divine resting-place. Men sometimes read their Bibles, and fail to understand them; we should be ready, like Philip, to instruct the inquirer in the meaning of God’s Word, the way of salvation, and the life of godliness. Lights are also used for <i>warning</i>. On our rocks and shoals a light-house is sure to be erected. Christian men should know that there are many false lights shown everywhere in the world, and therefore the right light is needed. The wreckers of Satan are always abroad, tempting the ungodly to sin under the name of pleasure; they hoist the wrong light, be it ours to put up the true light upon every dangerous rock, to point out every sin, and tell what it leads to, that so we may be clear of the blood of all men, shining as lights in the world. Lights also have a very <i>cheering</i> influence, and so have Christians. A Christian ought to be a comforter, with kind words on his lips, and sympathy in his heart; he should carry sunshine wherever he goes, and diffuse happiness around him.","Gracious Spirit dwell with me;","I myself would gracious be,","And with words that help and heal","Would thy life in mine reveal,","And with actions bold and meek","Would for Christ my Saviour speak."]},"Evening":{"verses":[{"passage":"If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.","reference":{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"5","verse":"18"}}],"reading":["He who looks at his own character and position from a legal point of view, will not only despair when he comes to the <i>end</i> of his reckoning, but if he be a wise man he will despair at the <i>beginning</i>; for if we are to be judged on the footing of the law, there shall no flesh living be justified. How blessed to know that we dwell in the domains of grace and not of law! When thinking of my state before God the question is not, “Am I perfect in myself before the law?” but, “Am I perfect in Christ Jesus?” That is a very different matter. We need not enquire, “Am I without sin naturally?” but, “Have I been washed in the fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness?” It is not “Am I in myself well pleasing to God?” but it is “Am I accepted in the Beloved?” The Christian views his evidences from the top of Sinai, and grows alarmed concerning his salvation; it were better far if he read his title by the light of Calvary. “Why,” saith he, “my faith has unbelief in it, it is not able to save me.” Suppose he had considered <i>the object</i> of his faith instead of his faith, then he would have said, “There is no failure in <i>him</i>, and therefore I am safe.” He sighs over his hope: “Ah! my hope is marred and dimmed by an anxious carefulness about present things; how can I be accepted?” Had he regarded <i>the ground</i> of his hope, he would have seen that the promise of God standeth sure, and that whatever our doubts may be, the oath and promise never fail. Ah! believer, it is safer always for you to be led of the Spirit into gospel liberty than to wear legal fetters. Judge yourself at what <i>Christ</i> is rather than at what <i>you</i> are. Satan will try to mar your peace by reminding you of your sinfulness and imperfections: you can only meet his accusations by faithfully adhering to the gospel and refusing to wear the yoke of bondage."]}}}
