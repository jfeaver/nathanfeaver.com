{"month":"december","date":"18","entry":{"Morning":{"verses":[{"passage":"Rend your heart, and not your garments.","reference":{"book":"Joel","chapter":"2","verse":"13"}}],"reading":["<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\" id=\"d1218am-p3.1\">Garment-rending</span> and other outward signs of religious emotion, are easily manifested and are <i>frequently </i><i>hypocritical</i>; but to feel true repentance is far more difficult, and consequently far less common. Men will attend to the most multiplied and minute ceremonial regulations—for such things are <i>pleasing to the flesh</i>—but true religion is too humbling, too heart-searching, too thorough for the tastes of the carnal men; they prefer something more ostentatious, flimsy, and worldly. Outward observances are <i>temporarily </i><i>comfortable</i>; eye and ear are pleased; self-conceit is fed, and self-righteousness is puffed up: but they are <i>ultimately </i><i>delusive</i>, for in the article of death, and at the day of judgment, the soul needs something more substantial than ceremonies and rituals to lean upon. Apart from vital godliness all religion is utterly vain; offered without a sincere heart, every form of worship is a solemn sham and an impudent mockery of the majesty of heaven.","<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\" id=\"d1218am-p4.1\">Heart-rending</span> is <i>divinely wrought and solemnly felt</i>. It is a secret grief which is <i>personally experienced</i>, not in mere form, but as a deep, soul-moving work of the Holy Spirit upon the inmost heart of each believer. It is not a matter to be merely talked of and believed in, but keenly and sensitively felt in every living child of the living God. It is <i>powerfully </i><i>humiliating</i>, and completely sin-purging; but then it is <i>sweetly preparative</i> for those gracious consolations which proud unhumbled spirits are unable to receive; and it is <i>distinctly discriminating</i>, for it belongs to the elect of God, and to them alone.","The text commands us to rend our hearts, but they are naturally hard as marble: how, then, can this be done? We must take them to Calvary: a dying Saviour’s voice rent the rocks once, and it is as powerful now. O blessed Spirit, let us hear the death-cries of Jesus, and our hearts shall be rent even as men rend their vestures in the day of lamentation."]},"Evening":{"verses":[{"passage":"Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.","reference":{"book":"Proverbs","chapter":"27","verse":"23"}}],"reading":["Every wise merchant will occasionally hold a stock-taking, when he will cast up his accounts, examine what he has on hand, and ascertain decisively whether his trade is prosperous or declining. Every man who is wise in the kingdom of heaven, will cry, “Search me, O God, and try me”; and he will frequently set apart special seasons for self-examination, to discover whether things are right between God and his soul. The God whom we worship is a great heart-searcher; and of old his servants knew him as “the Lord which searcheth the heart and trieth the reins of the children of men.” Let me stir you up in his name to make diligent search and solemn trial of your state, lest you come short of the promised rest. That which every wise man does, that which God himself does with us all, I exhort you to do with yourself this evening. Let the oldest saint look well to the fundamentals of his piety, for grey heads may cover black hearts: and let not the young professor despise the word of warning, for the greenness of youth may be joined to the rottenness of hypocrisy. Every now and then a cedar falls into our midst. The enemy still continues to sow tares among the wheat. It is not my aim to introduce doubts and fears into your mind; nay, verily, but I shall hope the rather that the rough wind of self-examination may help to drive them away. It is not security, but carnal security, which we would kill; not confidence, but fleshly confidence, which we would overthrow; not peace, but false peace, which we would destroy. By the precious blood of Christ, which was not shed to make you a hypocrite, but that sincere souls might show forth his praise, I beseech you, search and look, lest at the last it be said of you, “Mene, Mene, Tekel: thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.”"]}}}
