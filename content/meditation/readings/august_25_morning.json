{"verses":[{"passage":"His fruit was sweet to my taste.","reference":{"book":"Song of Solomon","chapter":"2","verse":"3"}}],"reading":["Faith, in the Scripture, is spoken of under the emblem of all the senses. It is <i>sight</i>: “Look unto me and be ye saved.” It is <i>hearing</i>: “Hear, and your soul shall live.” Faith is <i>smelling</i>: “All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia”; “thy name is as ointment poured forth.” Faith is spiritual <i>touch</i>. By this faith the woman came behind and touched the hem of Christ’s garment, and by this we handle the things of the good word of life. Faith is equally the spirit’s taste. “How sweet are thy words to my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my lips.” “Except a man eat my flesh,” saith Christ, <i>“and drink my blood, there is no life in him.”</i>","This “<i>taste</i>” is faith <i>in one of its highest </i><i>operations</i>. One of the first performances of faith is <i>hearing</i>. We hear the voice of God, not with the outward ear alone, but with the inward ear; we hear it as God’s Word, and we believe it to be so; that is the “hearing” of faith. Then our mind <i>looketh</i> upon the truth as it is presented to us; that is to say, we understand it, we perceive its meaning; that is the “seeing” of faith. Next we discover its preciousness; we begin to admire it, and find how fragrant it is; that is faith in its “<i>smell</i>.” Then we appropriate the mercies which are prepared for us in Christ; that is faith in its “<i>touch</i>.” Hence follow the enjoyments, peace, delight, communion; which are faith in its “taste.” Any one of these acts of faith is saving. To hear Christ’s voice as the sure voice of God in the soul will save us; but that which gives true enjoyment is the aspect of faith wherein Christ, by holy taste, is received into us, and made, by inward and spiritual apprehension of his sweetness and preciousness, to be the food of our souls. It is then we sit “under his shadow with great delight,” and find his fruit sweet to our taste."]}
