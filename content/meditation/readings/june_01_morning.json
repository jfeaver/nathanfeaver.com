{"verses":[{"passage":"The evening and the morning were the first day.","reference":{"book":"Genesis","chapter":"1","verse":"5"}}],"reading":["Was it so even in the beginning? Did light and darkness divide the realm of time in the first day? Then little wonder is it if I have also changes in my circumstances from the sunshine of prosperity to the midnight of adversity. It will not always be the blaze of noon even in my soul concerns, I must expect at seasons to mourn the absence of my former joys, and seek my Beloved in the night. Nor am I alone in this, for all the Lord’s beloved ones have had to sing the mingled song of judgment and of mercy, of trial and deliverance, of mourning and of delight. It is one of the arrangements of Divine providence that day and night shall not cease either in the spiritual or natural creation till we reach the land of which it is written, “there is no night there.” What our heavenly Father ordains is wise and good.","What, then, my soul, is it best for thee to do? Learn first <i>to be content</i> with this divine order, and be willing, with Job, to receive evil from the hand of the Lord as well as good. Study next, to <i>make the outgoings of the morning and the </i><i>evening to rejoice</i>. Praise the Lord for the sun of joy when it rises, and for the gloom of evening as it falls. There is beauty both in sunrise and sunset; sing of it, and glorify the Lord. Like the nightingale, pour forth thy notes at all hours. <i>Believe that the night is as useful as the day</i>. The dews of grace fall heavily in the night of sorrow. The stars of promise shine forth gloriously amid the darkness of grief. <i>Continue </i><i>thy service</i> under all changes. If in the day thy watchword be <i>labour</i>, at night exchange it for <i>watch</i>. Every hour has its duty, do thou continue in thy calling as the Lord’s servant until he shall suddenly appear in his glory. My soul, thine evening of old age and death is drawing near; dread it not, for it is part of the day; and the Lord has said, “I will cover him all the day long.”"]}
