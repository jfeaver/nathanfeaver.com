{"verses":[{"passage":"In the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.","reference":{"book":"Philippians","chapter":"2","verse":"15"}}],"reading":["We use lights to <i>make manifest</i>. A Christian man should so shine in his life, that a person could not live with him a week without knowing the gospel. His conversation should be such that all who are about him should clearly perceive whose he is, and whom he serves; and should see the image of Jesus reflected in his daily actions. Lights are intended for <i>guidance</i>. We are to help those around us who are in the dark. We are to hold forth to them the Word of life. We are to point sinners to the Saviour, and the weary to a divine resting-place. Men sometimes read their Bibles, and fail to understand them; we should be ready, like Philip, to instruct the inquirer in the meaning of Godâ€™s Word, the way of salvation, and the life of godliness. Lights are also used for <i>warning</i>. On our rocks and shoals a light-house is sure to be erected. Christian men should know that there are many false lights shown everywhere in the world, and therefore the right light is needed. The wreckers of Satan are always abroad, tempting the ungodly to sin under the name of pleasure; they hoist the wrong light, be it ours to put up the true light upon every dangerous rock, to point out every sin, and tell what it leads to, that so we may be clear of the blood of all men, shining as lights in the world. Lights also have a very <i>cheering</i> influence, and so have Christians. A Christian ought to be a comforter, with kind words on his lips, and sympathy in his heart; he should carry sunshine wherever he goes, and diffuse happiness around him.","Gracious Spirit dwell with me;","I myself would gracious be,","And with words that help and heal","Would thy life in mine reveal,","And with actions bold and meek","Would for Christ my Saviour speak."]}
