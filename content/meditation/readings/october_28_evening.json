{"verses":[{"passage":"His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.","reference":{"book":"Song of Solomon","chapter":"5","verse":"11"}}],"reading":["Comparisons all fail to set forth the Lord Jesus, but the spouse uses the best within her reach. By <i>the head</i> of Jesus we may understand his deity, “for the head of Christ is God” and then the ingot of purest gold is the best conceivable metaphor, but all too poor to describe one so precious, so pure, so dear, so glorious. Jesus is not a grain of gold, but a vast globe of it, a priceless mass of treasure such as earth and heaven cannot excel. The creatures are mere iron and clay, they all shall perish like wood, hay, and stubble, but the ever living Head of the creation of God shall shine on forever and ever. In him is no mixture, nor smallest taint of alloy. He is forever infinitely holy and altogether divine. <i>The bushy locks</i> depict his manly vigour. There is nothing effeminate in our Beloved. He is the manliest of men. Bold as a lion, laborious as an ox, swift as an eagle. Every conceivable and inconceivable beauty is to be found in him, though once he was despised and rejected of men.","The glory of his head is not shorn away, he is eternally crowned with peerless majesty. <i>The black hair</i> indicates youthful freshness, for Jesus has the dew of his youth upon him. Others grow languid with age, but he is forever a Priest as was Melchizedek; others come and go, but he abides as God upon his throne, world without end. We will behold him tonight and adore him. Angels are gazing upon him—his redeemed must not turn away their eyes from him. Where else is there such a Beloved? O for an hour’s fellowship with him! Away, ye intruding cares! Jesus draws me, and I run after him.","“His head the finest gold;","With secret sweet perfume,","His curled locks hang all as black","As any raven’s plume.”"]}
