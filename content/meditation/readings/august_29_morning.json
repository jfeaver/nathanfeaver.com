The best of men are conscious above all others that they are men at the best. Empty boats float high, but heavily laden vessels are low in the water; mere professors can boast, but true children of God cry for mercy upon their unprofitableness. We have need that the Lord should have mercy upon our good works, our prayers, our preachings, our alms-givings, and our holiest things. The blood was not only sprinkled upon the doorposts of Israel’s dwelling houses, but upon the sanctuary, the mercy-seat, and the altar, because as sin intrudes into our holiest things, the blood of Jesus is needed to purify them from defilement. If mercy be needed to be exercised towards our duties, what shall be said of our sins? How sweet the remembrance that inexhaustible mercy is waiting to be gracious to us, to restore our backslidings, and make our broken bones rejoice!","<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\" id=\"d0829am-p3.3\">William Carey, Born August</span> 17th, 1761: <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\" id=\"d0829am-p3.4\">Died</span> - -","“A wretched, poor, and helpless worm","On thy kind arms I fall.”"]}
