{"verses":[{"passage":"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.","reference":{"book":"Song of Solomon","chapter":"1","verse":"2"}}],"reading":["For several days we have been dwelling upon the Saviour’s passion, and for some little time to come we shall linger there. In beginning a new month, let us seek the same desires after our Lord as those which glowed in the heart of the elect spouse. See how she leaps at once to <i>him</i>; there are no prefatory words; she does not even mention his name; she is in the heart of her theme at once, for she speaks of <i>him</i> who was the only him in the world to her. How bold is her love! It was much condescension which permitted the weeping penitent to anoint his feet with spikenard—it was rich love which allowed the gentle Mary to sit at his feet and learn of him—but here, love, strong, fervent love, aspires to higher tokens of regard, and closer signs of fellowship. Esther trembled in the presence of Ahasuerus, but the spouse in joyful liberty of perfect love knows no fear. If we have received the same free spirit, we also may ask the like. By kisses we suppose to be intended those varied manifestations of affection by which the believer is made to enjoy the love of Jesus. The kiss of <i>reconciliation</i> we enjoyed at our conversion, and it was sweet as honey dropping from the comb. The kiss of <i>acceptance</i> is still warm on our brow, as we know that he hath accepted our persons and our works through rich grace. The kiss of daily, present <i>communion</i> is that which we pant after to be repeated day after day, till it is changed into the kiss of <i>reception</i>, which removes the soul from earth, and the kiss of <i>consummation</i> which fills it with the joy of heaven. Faith is our walk, but fellowship sensibly felt is our rest. Faith is the road, but communion with Jesus is the well from which the pilgrim drinks. O lover of our souls, be not strange to us; let the lips of thy blessing meet the lips of our asking; let the lips of thy fulness touch the lips of our need, and straightway the kiss will be effected."]}
