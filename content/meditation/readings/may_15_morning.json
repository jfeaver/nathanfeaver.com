{"verses":[{"passage":"All that believe are justified.","reference":{"book":"Acts","chapter":"13","verse":"39"}}],"reading":["The believer in Christ receives a <i>present</i> justification. Faith does not produce this fruit by-and-by, but <i>now</i>. So far as justification is the result of faith, it is given to the soul in the moment when it closes with Christ, and accepts him as its all in all. Are they who stand before the throne of God justified now?—so are we, as truly and as clearly justified as they who walk in white and sing melodious praises to celestial harps. The thief upon the cross was justified the moment that he turned the eye of faith to Jesus; and Paul, the aged, after years of service, was not more justified than was the thief with no service at all. We are <i>today</i> accepted in the Beloved, <i>today</i> absolved from sin, <i>today</i> acquitted at the bar of God. Oh! soul-transporting thought! There are some clusters of Eshcol’s vine which we shall not be able to gather till we enter heaven; but this is a bough which runneth over the wall. This is not as the corn of the land, which we can never eat till we cross the Jordan; but this is part of the manna in the wilderness, a portion of our daily nutriment with which God supplies us in our journeying to and fro. We are <i>now</i>—even <i>now</i> pardoned; even <i>now</i> are our sins put away; even <i>now</i> we stand in the sight of God accepted, as though we had never been guilty. “There is therefore <i>now</i> no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.” There is not a sin in the Book of God, even <i>now</i>, against one of his people. Who dareth to lay anything to their charge? There is neither speck, nor spot, nor wrinkle, nor any such thing remaining upon any one believer in the matter of justification in the sight of the Judge of all the earth. Let present privilege awaken us to present duty, and now, while life lasts, let us spend and be spent for our sweet Lord Jesus."]}
