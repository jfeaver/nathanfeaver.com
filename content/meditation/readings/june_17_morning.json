{"verses":[{"passage":"Help, Lord.","reference":{"book":"Psalm","chapter":"12","verse":"1"}}],"reading":["<i>The prayer itself is remarkable</i>, for it is <i>short</i>, but <i>seasonable, sententious</i>, and <i>suggestive</i>. David mourned the fewness of faithful men, and therefore lifted up his heart in supplication—when the creature failed, he flew to the Creator. He evidently felt his own weakness, or he would not have cried for help; but at the same time he intended honestly to exert himself for the cause of truth, for the word “help” is inapplicable where we ourselves do nothing. There is much of <i>directness, clearness of perception</i>, and <i>distinctness of </i><i>utterance</i> in this petition of two words; much more, indeed, than in the long rambling outpourings of certain professors. The Psalmist runs straight-forward to his God, with a well-considered prayer; he knows what he is seeking, and where to seek it. Lord, teach us to pray in the same blessed manner.","<i>The occasions for the use of this prayer are frequent</i>. In providential afflictions how suitable it is for tried believers who find all helpers failing them. Students, in <i>doctrinal </i><i>difficulties</i>, may often obtain aid by lifting up this cry of “Help, Lord,” to the Holy Spirit, the great Teacher. Spiritual warriors in <i>inward conflicts</i> may send to the throne for reinforcements, and this will be a model for their request. Workers in <i>heavenly labour</i> may thus obtain grace in time of need. Seeking sinners, in <i>doubts and alarms</i>, may offer up the same weighty supplication; in fact, in all these cases, times, and places, this will serve the turn of needy souls. “Help, Lord,” will suit us living and dying, suffering or labouring, rejoicing or sorrowing. In him our help is found, let us not be slack to cry to him.","<i>The answer to the prayer is certain</i>, if it be sincerely offered through Jesus. The Lord’s character assures us that he will not leave his people; his relationship as Father and Husband guarantee us his aid; his gift of Jesus is a pledge of every good thing; and his sure promise stands, “Fear not, <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\" id=\"d0617am-p5.1\">I will help thee</span>.”"]}
