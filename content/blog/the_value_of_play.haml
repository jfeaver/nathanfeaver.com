%h3 Do you realize the enormous value of working on fun, personal projects?

%p
  Having fun is the foundation of my career. Some people hope to enjoy their
  jobs some day. If I didn't enjoy my job and didn't keep going on my own time then I
  never would have entered the profession!

  Lately, I've been mastering the nuances of JavaScript during my off hours.  I've loved
  learning how to make snappy interfaces and pondering the usage of closures.  I love that
  after all that fun I also earn a super valuable skill!
%p
  I've been playing with the language for a long time on a basic level:  Calculating
  styles based on window size, adding a text box counter, creating nifty roll over and
  click events.  This stage of learning was essential for me: I clearly saw that
  JavaScript was not another class-based object-oriented language like Ruby, Java, and
  C++.  I started paying close attention to how others were using the language to
  be effective and expressive.

  Today, I'm playing around with fully client side applications and contributing to
  a JavaScript framework at work.  A long ways from the basic JavaScript that I
  was writing just a year or two ago!
%p
  I love having a job where regularly playing with new things has such a high value!
  Getting paid to have fun??  Who'da thunk!
