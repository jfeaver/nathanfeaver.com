%h2 About Nathan
%p
  I've been building websites professionally since mid-2011.  For me, the thrill of
  building websites is in seeing awesome functionality and design come together
  seemlessly.  I also enjoy the problem solving nature of web development and the art
  of communication through code.

  My wife, Amy, and I live along the creek path in Boulder, Colorado (possibly the best
  place ever?).  We love our outdoor activities: biking, climbing, soccer, skiing, and disc golf.

    Why is programming fun? What delights may its practioner expect as his reward?

    First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.
