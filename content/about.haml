%h2 About Nathan
%p
  I've been building websites professionally since mid-2011.  For me, the thrill of
  building websites is in seeing awesome functionality and design come together
  seemlessly.  I also enjoy the problem solving nature of the job which makes
  writing clean, object-oriented code like the icing on the cake.

  My wife, Amy, and I live along the creek path in Boulder, Colorado (possibly the best
  place ever?).  We love our outdoor activities: biking, climbing, soccer, skiing, and disc golf.

    Why is programming fun? What delights may its practioner expect as his reward?
  %p
    First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.
