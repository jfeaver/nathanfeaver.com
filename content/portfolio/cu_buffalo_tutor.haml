description: 
  - "I created a custom WordPress website for Buffalo Tutor to inform students of services beyond basic tutoring and convert visitors into clients. This site was created on the <a href='http://foundation.zurb.com/'>Foundation CSS Framework</a> to provide a mobile-friendly website that students reading flyers in the hallway could easily navigate."
  - "The mobile-friendly layout of this site worked well with the fun/cartoony look that Buffalo Tutor wanted.  Unfortunately, the site that I built was never published because of it couldn't be finished within budget.  This was a lesson in up-front client communication for me."
