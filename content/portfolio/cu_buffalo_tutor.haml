description: 
  - "I created a custom WordPress website for Buffalo Tutor to inform students of services beyond basic tutoring and convert visitors into clients. This site was created on the <a href='http://foundation.zurb.com/'>Foundation CSS Framework</a> to provide a <a href='http://github.com/jfeaver/MobileWordpress'>mobile-friendly website</a> that students reading flyers in the hallway could easily navigate. The mobile-friendly layout of this site worked well with the fun/cartoony look that Buffalo Tutor wanted."
  - "I also helped the client understand some principals of SEO and modified an existing site to have better SEO performance."
