  - "I built Vidusic with the intention of sharing my favorite music videos with friends and family.  I also subscribe to the <a href='http://norvig.com/21-days.html'>'Learn by Doing Method'</a> and worked on this to continue learning Ruby on Rails (I had been playing with Rails since Feb 2012 but this was my first published app)."
  - "I continue to update this site with a few videos each week. If it loads slowly, it is because I'm on the free-usage tier at Heroku. Enjoy!"
