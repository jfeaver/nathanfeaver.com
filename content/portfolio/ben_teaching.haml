description: 
  - "For this website, I ported an existing PHP backed website into WordPress for easier maintenance for the client (a math graduate student teacher at CU).  I created a custom plugin to help the client post announcements and new homeworks on various pages of his site.  In addition, I learned how to set up and configure a MySQL database on a remote server for the first time."
